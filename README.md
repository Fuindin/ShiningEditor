# ShiningEditor
Shining Editor is a Genesis / Mega Drive save state editor that allows a user to edit save states for Shining in the Darkness. Eventually I would like to add support for Shining Force and Shining Force 2 save states.

This project was written in C# using Visual Studio 2017. The program currently works with save states for Shining in the Darkness that were generated from the Fusion364 emulator (.gs0, .gsx files). *Make sure to create a backup of your save state file before editing just in case something doesn't go quite right.

This editor allows the user to modify the gold, experience, and character stats for characters in the game.
