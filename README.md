# ShiningEditor
Shining Editor is a Genesis / Mega Drive save state editor that allows a user to edit save states for Shining in the Darkness and Shining Force. Eventually I would like to add support for Shining Force 2 save states.

This project was written in C# using Visual Studio 2017. The program currently works with save states for Shining in the Darkness and Shining Force that were generated from the Fusion364 emulator (.gs0, .gsx files). *Make sure to create a backup of your save state file before editing just in case something doesn't go quite right.

This editor allows the user to modify the gold, experience, and character stats for characters in the game. The editor for Shining Force save states also displays the character's current items and magic. Updating item and magic in Shining Force is not present at this time.
